# Course resources (placeholder)

Add your course files here so they open in the LMS viewer:

- **slides.pptx** — PPT slides (replace with your file or keep this name when you upload)
- **notes.pdf** — PDF notes (replace with your file or keep this name when you upload)

Instructors can upload files elsewhere and link to them; the course page uses these paths by default. Any file URL (including from your backend/CDN) will open in the in-LMS viewer with a Download option.
